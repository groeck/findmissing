findmissing - find missing commits in stable releases

To initialize, run "setup.sh" once.

Subsequently, run "initdb.py", which will update the databases.
Then run "missing.py" to get a list of commits missing from stable
releases. Run "missing.py 4.19" to get a list of patches missing
from linux-4.19.y.
